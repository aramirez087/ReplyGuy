# Session 07: Docs, Messaging, and Developer Guidance

Paste this into a new Claude Code session:

```md
Continue from Session 06 artifacts.

Mission:
Rewrite onboarding docs so users immediately understand the new fast path, then discover advanced options naturally.

Target docs:
- `README.md`
- `docs/getting-started.md`
- `docs/cli-reference.md`
- `docs/configuration.md`
- Any onboarding section that still implies heavyweight mandatory setup.

Tasks:
1. Put Quickstart first, with exact commands and expected outcomes.
2. Add a dedicated "Hello World in under 2 minutes" section.
3. Move advanced setup to an explicit second phase.
4. Ensure CLI examples match the real commands implemented.
5. Remove contradictory or stale guidance.

Deliverables:
1. Updated docs.
2. `docs/roadmap/init-simplification/session-07-doc-audit.md` with:
   - Before vs after command flow
   - List of removed complexity points
   - Any remaining doc debt

Exit criteria:
- A new user can follow docs to first success with minimal setup.
- Advanced configuration is clearly discoverable but non-blocking.
- No outdated command examples remain.
```
