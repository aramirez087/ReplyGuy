## Completion Summary

### Files Created
- `crates/tuitbot-mcp/src/tools/conformance_tests/live.rs` — 10 live conformance tests (`#[ignore]`, gated on env vars)
- `crates/tuitbot-mcp/src/tools/conformance_tests/coverage.rs` — Coverage report generator producing JSON + markdown
- `scripts/run-conformance.sh` — Harness wrapper script with 3 modes (deterministic, live, report-only)
- `docs/generated/coverage-report.json` — Machine-readable coverage (73KB)
- `docs/generated/coverage-report.md` — Human-readable coverage report
- `docs/roadmap/x-api-surface-expansion/session-09-handoff.md` — Handoff document

### Files Modified
- `crates/tuitbot-mcp/src/tools/conformance_tests/mod.rs` — Added `live` and `coverage` modules
- `roadmap/artifacts/session-06-tool-manifest.json` — Regenerated manifest snapshot (109 tools)
- Various `roadmap/artifacts/session-09-*` — Refreshed by test runs

### Tests Run
| Suite | Passed | Failed | Ignored |
|-------|--------|--------|---------|
| tuitbot-cli | 118 | 0 | 0 |
| tuitbot-core | 730 | 0 | 0 |
| tuitbot-mcp | 408 | 0 | 10 |
| tuitbot-server | 31 | 0 | 0 |
| **Total** | **1288** | **0** | **10** |

CI checks: `cargo fmt` clean, `cargo clippy` clean, all tests pass.

### Key Decisions
1. **Live tests use `#[ignore]`** — Never run in normal CI. Gated on `TUITBOT_TEST_BEARER_TOKEN` env var.
2. **`get_tweet_by_id`** is the manifest name (not `x_get_tweet`) — discovered and corrected during validation.
3. **Coverage report is deterministic** — Generated purely from manifest introspection, no network calls.
4. **41.3% test coverage** (45/109 tools tested) — The 64 untested tools are primarily the 36 generated L2 spec-pack tools (lists, mutes, blocks, spaces) and composite/content workflow tools.

### Warnings for Next Session
- The pre-existing `env_var_override_approval_mode` test in tuitbot-core is flaky when run in parallel (env var race). Passes with `--test-threads=1`.
- The 36 generated (L2) spec-pack tools have 0% test coverage — they are the biggest gap.
