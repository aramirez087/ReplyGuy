## Session 11 Completion Summary

### Files Created
- `docs/roadmap/x-api-surface-expansion/release-checklist.md` — Verified release checklist
- `docs/roadmap/x-api-surface-expansion/go-no-go-report.md` — Evidence-based go/no-go assessment
- `docs/roadmap/x-api-surface-expansion/session-11-handoff.md` — Handoff document
- `docs/generated/mcp-manifest-write.json` — Write profile manifest (104 tools)
- `docs/generated/mcp-manifest-admin.json` — Admin profile manifest (108 tools)

### Files Modified
- `crates/tuitbot-mcp/src/server/admin.rs` — Fixed misleading "policy-gated" docstrings to "admin-only, host-constrained"
- `docs/mcp-reference.md` — Corrected admin profile policy enforcement claims
- `docs/configuration.md` — Corrected admin profile policy description
- `docs/cli-reference.md` — Updated from "Full profile (64 tools)" to current 4-profile model
- `docs/contributing.md` — Updated manifest file list

### Files Removed
- `docs/generated/mcp-manifest-full.json` — Replaced by `mcp-manifest-write.json`

### Tests Run
- `cargo fmt --all --check` — clean
- `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` — clean
- `cargo test --workspace -- --test-threads=1` — **1288 passed, 0 failed, 10 ignored**
- Conformance harness — **120 passed, 0 failed, 10 ignored**
- Manifest sync check — **all 4 in sync**

### Key Decisions
1. **Recommendation: GO** — All 109 tools operational, safety infrastructure verified, documentation accurate
2. **Corrected documentation/code mismatch** — Universal request mutations were falsely documented as policy-gated; fixed docs to reflect actual enforcement (host allowlist + SSRF guard + admin-only profile)
3. **Three post-launch remediations identified**: (1) Add policy engine to universal requests, (2) DM path-prefix denylist, (3) Test coverage to 70%+

### Warnings
- Universal request mutations (x_post/x_put/x_delete) bypass policy engine and mutation audit — constrained only by host allowlist, SSRF guard, and admin profile isolation. Remediation planned as Priority 1 before first external user.
