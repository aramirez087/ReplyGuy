## Completion Summary

### Files Created (4 deliverables)

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|------|------:|---------|
| `docs/roadmap/utility-toolkit-autopilot-convergence/charter.md` | 301 | Architecture charter: mission, gap analysis (6 gaps), three-layer target architecture, MCP profile mapping, dependency rules, migration strategy, success criteria |
| `docs/roadmap/utility-toolkit-autopilot-convergence/architecture-decisions.md` | 386 | 14 non-negotiable design decisions (AD-01 through AD-14) with rationale and rejected alternatives |
| `docs/roadmap/utility-toolkit-autopilot-convergence/execution-plan.md` | 368 | Locked 7-session plan (Sessions 02-08) with inputs, tasks, outputs, exit criteria, risks, and dependency graph |
| `docs/roadmap/utility-toolkit-autopilot-convergence/session-01-handoff.md` | 112 | Handoff: completed work, decisions, Session 02 exact inputs (11 file paths + baseline commands) |

### Tests Run
- No Rust code changed — CI checks not applicable for this documentation-only session.

### Key Decisions Made
- **Three-layer model**: Toolkit (`core::toolkit/`), Workflow (`core::workflow/`), Autopilot (`core::automation/` refactored)
- **Module-level layering** within `tuitbot-core`, not new crates (AD-01)
- **Toolkit is stateless** over `&dyn XApiClient` (AD-02)
- **Workflow uses `WorkflowCtx`** with borrowed references (AD-03, AD-14)
- **No policy in toolkit** — raw writes, policy centralized in workflow (AD-04, AD-05)
- **Autopilot never calls XApiClient directly** (AD-06)
- **MCP profiles and envelope unchanged** (AD-07, AD-08)
- **14 total decisions**, zero unresolved

### Warnings for Next Session
- Session 02 should record baseline test counts and MCP tool counts before making any changes (commands provided in handoff).
- `adapters.rs` (39KB) is the largest risk in Session 07 — plan for systematic trait-by-trait replacement.
- Sessions 06 and 07 are independent and can run in parallel if needed.
