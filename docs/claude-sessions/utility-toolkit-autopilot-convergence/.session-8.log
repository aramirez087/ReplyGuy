## Completion Summary

### Files Created/Modified
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — Updated Architecture section with Three-Layer Model table and dependency rules
- **`docs/roadmap/.../final-validation-report.md`** — Created: full quality gate results, charter criteria evaluation
- **`docs/roadmap/.../go-no-go.md`** — Created: **GO** decision with evidence matrix
- **`docs/roadmap/.../post-epic-retrospective.md`** — Created: accomplishments, lessons, P1/P2/P3 follow-ups
- **`docs/roadmap/.../session-08-handoff.md`** — Created: final handoff with epic summary

### Tests Run and Results
| Suite | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `cargo fmt --all --check` | PASS |
| `cargo test --workspace` (1399 tests) | PASS |
| `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` | PASS (0 warnings) |
| Manifest sync (4 profiles) | PASS |
| MCP conformance (34 tests) | PASS |
| MCP boundary (40 tests) | PASS |
| MCP eval harness (4 scenarios) | PASS |
| Toolkit + workflow e2e (15 tests) | PASS |
| `cargo package --workspace` | PASS (all 4 crates) |

### Key Decisions
- **GO recommendation issued** — 0 hard blockers, branch ready for merge to `main`
- **Env-var test flake** documented as pre-existing (passes with `--test-threads=1`)
- **AD-06 partial enforcement** documented as P1 follow-up (loops use `adapters.rs` delegation, functionally correct but not fully decoupled)
- **CLAUDE.md scope** — Added Three-Layer Model subsection; kept existing module table with toolkit/workflow additions

### Warnings/Follow-Up Items
1. **P1**: AD-06 full enforcement — refactor loops to bypass `loop_helpers` trait indirection (~1 session)
2. **P1**: Unify `propose_queue.rs` to use `run_gateway` (~1 hour)
3. **P1**: Split `workflow/tests.rs` (781 lines → module directory) (~1 hour)
4. **P2**: Fix env-var test race with `#[serial]` attribute
5. **P2**: Update yanked `wasm-bindgen` in lockfile
