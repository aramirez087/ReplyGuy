# Session 03 Prompt - Competitor Battlefield

## Copy/paste prompt

You are executing Session 03 for Tuitbot in `/Users/aramirez/Code/ReplyGuy`.
Mission: win positioning by mapping the battlefield and identifying where Tuitbot can dominate.

Critical constraints:

- Use current, source-linked evidence for competitor claims.
- Separate direct, secondary, and indirect competition.
- Focus on decision-driving insights, not long generic comparisons.

Required work:

1. Build a competitor set by ICP use case.
2. Compare each competitor on:
- discovery capability
- content quality control
- safety/compliance posture
- analytics/strategy depth
- operating flexibility (desktop/self-host/cloud)
3. Identify category gaps where customer pain is still unresolved.
4. Build battlecards for top 5 competitors.
5. Draft Tuitbot's positioning statement and category narrative.

Required artifacts:

- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-03-competitor-matrix.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-03-category-gaps.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-03-battlecards.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-03-positioning-statement.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-03-handoff.md`

Definition of done:

- Competitor matrix has source links and date stamps.
- Positioning statement highlights a clear strategic tradeoff.
- Battlecards include objection handling and displacement plays.

Final output format:

1. Where Tuitbot can win now
2. Where Tuitbot should avoid direct competition
3. What Session 04 must package into the offer
