# Session 05 Prompt - Funnel and Instrumentation

## Copy/paste prompt

You are executing Session 05 for Tuitbot in `/Users/aramirez/Code/ReplyGuy`.
Mission: define the measurable growth funnel and required tracking so every future decision is evidence-based.

Critical constraints:

- No metric without ownership and a clear action path.
- Favor event definitions that are implementation-ready.
- Keep the KPI surface focused on conversion and retention.

Required work:

1. Build the full funnel model:
- acquisition
- activation
- engagement
- retention
- monetization
- referral
2. Define critical events and properties per funnel stage.
3. Map existing instrumentation vs missing instrumentation.
4. Create a phased tracking implementation plan.
5. Define reporting views required for weekly and monthly reviews.

Required artifacts:

- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-05-funnel-model.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-05-event-taxonomy.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-05-tracking-gap-audit.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-05-reporting-spec.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-05-handoff.md`

Definition of done:

- Event taxonomy is consistent and de-duplicated.
- Missing instrumentation is prioritized by business impact.
- Reporting spec is enough for operator decision-making.

Final output format:

1. Funnel model summary
2. High-impact tracking gaps
3. What Session 06 will use to drive owned demand
