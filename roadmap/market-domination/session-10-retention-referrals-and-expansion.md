# Session 10 Prompt - Retention, Referrals, and Expansion

## Copy/paste prompt

You are executing Session 10 for Tuitbot in `/Users/aramirez/Code/ReplyGuy`.
Mission: turn acquired users into retained advocates and expansion revenue.

Critical constraints:

- Retention starts in onboarding; tie back to time-to-value.
- Referral loops must reward real outcomes, not empty invites.
- Expansion strategy should align to packaging and value metric decisions.

Required work:

1. Map the post-signup journey through first 30 days.
2. Define retention interventions by risk signal.
3. Design referral or affiliate mechanics for the primary ICP.
4. Define expansion triggers (plan upgrades, add-ons, usage thresholds).
5. Build lifecycle communication map (in-app + email + social proof loops).

Required artifacts:

- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-10-day-0-to-30-journey.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-10-retention-playbook.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-10-referral-design.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-10-expansion-triggers.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-10-handoff.md`

Definition of done:

- Journey map identifies drop-off risk and intervention points.
- Referral program has anti-abuse and economics checks.
- Expansion triggers map to measurable user value, not arbitrary limits.

Final output format:

1. Retention strategy summary
2. Referral/expansion design summary
3. What Session 11 will operationalize weekly
