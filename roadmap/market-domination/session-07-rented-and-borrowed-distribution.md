# Session 07 Prompt - Rented and Borrowed Distribution

## Copy/paste prompt

You are executing Session 07 for Tuitbot in `/Users/aramirez/Code/ReplyGuy`.
Mission: design predictable distribution on platforms and partner channels without becoming platform-dependent.

Critical constraints:

- Rented and borrowed channels must feed owned channels.
- Prioritize 1-2 rented channels and 2-3 borrowed channel plays.
- Choose tactics by ICP presence, not trend chasing.

Required work:

1. Build platform strategy for X and one secondary platform.
2. Create a repeatable short-form content format system.
3. Build a borrowed-channel target list (podcasts, newsletters, communities, partner tools).
4. Write outreach angle templates per borrowed channel type.
5. Design a monthly distribution cadence with measurable goals.

Required artifacts:

- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-07-platform-strategy.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-07-content-format-system.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-07-borrowed-channel-targets.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-07-outreach-templates.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-07-handoff.md`

Definition of done:

- Each rented/borrowed tactic has a clear objective and CTA.
- Partner target list is ranked by expected reach and fit.
- Cadence is realistic for current team capacity.

Final output format:

1. Channel mix recommendation
2. First-month execution plan
3. What Session 08 must convert on-site/in-product
