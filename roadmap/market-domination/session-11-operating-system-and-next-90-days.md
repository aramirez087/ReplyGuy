# Session 11 Prompt - Operating System and Next 90 Days

## Copy/paste prompt

You are executing Session 11 for Tuitbot in `/Users/aramirez/Code/ReplyGuy`.
Mission: consolidate all previous sessions into a single execution operating system for the next 90 days.

Critical constraints:

- Convert strategy into owners, deadlines, and measurable outcomes.
- Keep roadmap realistic for current team bandwidth.
- Prioritize compounding loops over one-off campaigns.

Required work:

1. Synthesize all previous session outputs.
2. Build a 90-day execution plan by week.
3. Define owners, dependencies, and risks for each initiative.
4. Build a weekly review playbook using `templates/weekly-growth-review-template.md`.
5. Define kill criteria and reallocation rules if experiments underperform.

Required artifacts:

- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-11-90-day-plan.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-11-owner-and-dependency-map.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-11-risk-register.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-11-weekly-review-playbook.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-11-handoff.md`

Definition of done:

- 90-day plan is sequenced and execution-ready.
- Weekly review process can run without rework.
- Success/failure thresholds are explicit for all top bets.

Final output format:

1. 90-day strategy summary
2. Top 5 execution priorities
3. Immediate first-week action list
