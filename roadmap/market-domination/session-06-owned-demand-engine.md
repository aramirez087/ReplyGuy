# Session 06 Prompt - Owned Demand Engine

## Copy/paste prompt

You are executing Session 06 for Tuitbot in `/Users/aramirez/Code/ReplyGuy`.
Mission: build an owned-channel growth engine that compounds over time.

Critical constraints:

- Owned channels are the strategic base (email + site + documentation + product surfaces).
- Content must map to ICP pains and stage of awareness.
- Every content asset needs a conversion objective.

Required work:

1. Define the owned-channel strategy for:
- website pages
- email/newsletter
- product education surfaces
- docs/knowledge content
2. Build a topic cluster map tied to ICP jobs-to-be-done.
3. Design lead magnets and conversion paths per cluster.
4. Create a 6-week editorial and distribution calendar.
5. Define update cadence for high-leverage evergreen pages.

Required artifacts:

- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-06-owned-channel-strategy.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-06-topic-clusters.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-06-lead-magnet-map.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-06-editorial-calendar.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-06-handoff.md`

Definition of done:

- Topic clusters align to ICP intent and product outcomes.
- Calendar includes owner, date, CTA, and KPI.
- Owned channels clearly collect and nurture audience attention.

Final output format:

1. Owned engine design summary
2. First 6-week content plan snapshot
3. What Session 07 will amplify through rented/borrowed channels
