# Session 02 Prompt - Niche Wedge and ICP

## Copy/paste prompt

You are executing Session 02 for Tuitbot in `/Users/aramirez/Code/ReplyGuy`.
Mission: choose the most winnable niche wedge and lock the ICP hierarchy.

Critical constraints:

- One clear wedge beats broad positioning.
- Prioritize segments where Tuitbot's current strengths are hardest to replicate.
- Keep segment choices tied to acquisition channels we can realistically run.

Required work:

1. Build a segment map for potential buyers (by company type, creator type, and maturity).
2. Score segments by urgency, willingness to pay, channel reachability, and competitive pressure.
3. Choose primary ICP, secondary ICP, and anti-ICP.
4. Define jobs-to-be-done and value claims by ICP.
5. Produce message pillars and proof requirements by ICP.

Required artifacts:

- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-02-segment-map.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-02-icp-prioritization.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-02-jtbd-by-icp.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-02-message-pillars.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-02-handoff.md`

Definition of done:

- Exactly one primary ICP is selected with clear rationale.
- Anti-ICP is explicit so scope drift is reduced.
- Message pillars map to measurable pains and outcomes.

Final output format:

1. Winning wedge summary
2. ICP/anti-ICP snapshot
3. What Session 03 must prove against competitors
