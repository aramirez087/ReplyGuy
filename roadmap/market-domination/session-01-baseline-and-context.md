# Session 01 Prompt - Baseline and Context

## Copy/paste prompt

You are executing Session 01 for Tuitbot in `/Users/aramirez/Code/ReplyGuy`.
Mission: establish the current truth about product, audience, messaging, and funnel baseline before optimization.

Critical constraints:

- Use repository assets as source of truth first (README, docs, dashboard flows, onboarding copy).
- Update `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` with confirmed facts and clearly tagged assumptions.
- Distinguish facts vs hypotheses.

Required work:

1. Audit all current public-facing messaging and value propositions.
2. Map the end-to-end funnel from discovery to activation.
3. Define current baseline metrics (or explicit placeholders where data is missing).
4. Identify top strategic risks that block niche leadership.
5. Create the first prioritized marketing backlog.

Required artifacts:

- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-01-message-audit.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-01-funnel-map.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-01-baseline-scoreboard.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-01-priority-backlog.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-01-handoff.md`

Definition of done:

- Context doc is updated and internally consistent.
- Funnel map includes stage goals, friction, and required instrumentation.
- Backlog is ranked by impact and implementation confidence.

Final output format:

1. Baseline strengths
2. Baseline gaps
3. What Session 02 will decide
