# Tuitbot Market Domination Roadmap

This folder contains copy/paste prompts to run AI sessions that build Tuitbot into the strongest competitor in its niche.

Program goal: own the founder-led X growth automation niche by building a repeatable engine across positioning, acquisition, conversion, retention, and compounding loops.

## System Design: The NDO Loop

Use this system every session:

1. **Truth**: capture evidence, not opinions.
2. **Decision**: choose one clear strategic path.
3. **Build**: ship assets, workflows, and experiments.
4. **Measure**: define success metrics and review windows.
5. **Iterate**: keep what works, cut what does not.

## Core Scoreboard

Track these metrics across the roadmap:

- Activation rate (signup -> first approved/published post)
- Week-1 retention
- Content output consistency (replies/posts per week)
- Reply acceptance/edit rate
- Time-to-value (signup -> first meaningful result)
- Trial-to-paid conversion (or activation proxy until pricing is live)
- Net follower growth and qualified inbound signals

## Session Order

## How To Use

1. Open one session file.
2. Copy/paste the prompt into a fresh AI session.
3. Require all listed artifacts before closing the session.
4. Store all outputs in `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/`.
5. Move to the next session only after acceptance criteria are met.

## Quality Bar (Every Session)

- Tie every decision to evidence from user data, product behavior, or clear market research.
- Keep assumptions explicit in an assumption register.
- Include one execution backlog and one experiment backlog.
- End every session with a handoff using `templates/session-handoff-template.md`.
- Update `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` when positioning facts change.
