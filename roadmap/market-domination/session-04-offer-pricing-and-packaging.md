# Session 04 Prompt - Offer, Pricing, and Packaging

## Copy/paste prompt

You are executing Session 04 for Tuitbot in `/Users/aramirez/Code/ReplyGuy`.
Mission: design an offer and pricing structure that maximizes adoption and monetization for the chosen wedge.

Critical constraints:

- Packaging must reflect real product value moments, not feature dumping.
- Use "good / better / best" logic with a clear upgrade reason.
- Define pricing hypotheses and validation experiments, not fixed guesses.

Required work:

1. Define core value metric candidates.
2. Build plan packaging options for target personas.
3. Draft pricing hypotheses, expected objections, and mitigation.
4. Design a trial/onboarding path tied to fastest time-to-value.
5. Create decision criteria for moving from hypothesis to production pricing.

Required artifacts:

- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-04-value-metric-options.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-04-packaging-v1.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-04-pricing-hypotheses.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-04-trial-design.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-04-handoff.md`

Definition of done:

- Packaging supports both activation and expansion.
- Each tier has a crisp "who it is for" statement.
- Pricing tests have clear pass/fail metrics.

Final output format:

1. Recommended packaging model
2. Pricing tests to run next
3. What Session 05 must instrument for measurement
