# Session 08 Prompt - Conversion Asset Sprint

## Copy/paste prompt

You are executing Session 08 for Tuitbot in `/Users/aramirez/Code/ReplyGuy`.
Mission: increase conversion quality by upgrading core assets across site, onboarding, and upgrade moments.

Critical constraints:

- Keep message consistency with the chosen wedge and positioning.
- Prioritize highest-traffic and highest-friction assets first.
- Every asset change must define a measurable hypothesis.

Required work:

1. Audit homepage, key landing pages, onboarding flow, and upgrade prompts/paywalls.
2. Rewrite priority copy blocks (headline, subhead, CTA, proof, objection handling).
3. Define A/B test candidates and expected impact.
4. Build an implementation backlog by effort and impact.
5. Create QA criteria to validate message and UX quality before release.

Required artifacts:

- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-08-conversion-audit.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-08-copy-architecture.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-08-ab-test-backlog.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-08-implementation-plan.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-08-handoff.md`

Definition of done:

- Top conversion surfaces have clear revised messaging.
- Test backlog includes hypothesis, metric, and stop conditions.
- Implementation plan identifies quick wins vs deeper builds.

Final output format:

1. Conversion bottleneck summary
2. Highest-impact copy and UX fixes
3. What Session 09 will launch publicly
