# Session 09 Prompt - Flagship Launch Campaign

## Copy/paste prompt

You are executing Session 09 for Tuitbot in `/Users/aramirez/Code/ReplyGuy`.
Mission: execute a flagship launch campaign that creates momentum and converts attention into owned audience and activated users.

Critical constraints:

- Build the campaign in phases: pre-launch, launch week, post-launch.
- Reuse the ORB model: owned, rented, borrowed channels.
- Treat launch as a sequence, not a single post.

Required work:

1. Define launch narrative and core message by audience segment.
2. Build a 21-day campaign timeline with daily actions.
3. Create campaign assets:
- primary launch post/page
- email sequence
- social set
- partner outreach
4. Define launch KPIs and monitoring plan.
5. Design post-launch follow-up to convert interest into activation.

Required artifacts:

- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-09-launch-narrative.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-09-21-day-campaign-plan.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-09-asset-checklist.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-09-launch-kpi-dashboard.md`
- `roadmap/market-domination/artifacts/session-09-handoff.md`

Definition of done:

- Campaign plan is channel-specific and time-bound.
- Asset checklist is complete and owner-assigned.
- KPI dashboard tracks leading and lagging indicators.

Final output format:

1. Launch thesis in one page
2. Campaign timeline summary
3. What Session 10 must retain and compound
